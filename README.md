Stock Price Prediction

A machine learning project designed to predict stock prices based on historical data. 
This project leverages data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive 
modeling techniques to provide insights into future stock performance.

Features
Data Collection: Imports stock market data using APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance).
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes trends and patterns in the data.
Predictive Modeling: Implements machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices.
Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly platform to input stock details and view predictions.
